However, with our hedge control strategy, we analyze the market trend based on a 3-day moving average and adjust our hedge position accordingly.\n\nDelta hedging on Blackhole Finance is powered by Aave, a lending protocol. A portion of deposited USDC.e is collateralized on Aave, and ETH is borrowed from them. As the ETH position is borrowed, even if the ETH price decreases, the vault can hedge a portion of losses compared to an unhedged position.\n\nSince price drops can often be sudden and steep, hedging downside risks helps to maintain portfolio value in the long run. Additionally, we reduce our hedge position with the hedge control strategy when the market is bullish, allowing for potential upside profit opportunities."},"2":{"TITLE":"WITHOUT HEDGE","CHART_NAME":"VULNERABLE ON DOWNWARD PRICE MOVEMENT"},"3":{"TITLE":"WITH HEDGE","CHART_NAME":"MITIGATE LOSSES CAUSED BY PRICE MOVEMENT"},"4":{"TITLE":"SMART LIQUIDITY","DESC":"Smart Liquidity determines the price range for providing liquidity on behalf of liquidity providers.

One is range settings for liquidity provision, the other is range settings to execute stop loss.

In such a case, the vault rebalances to set new ranges and start earning again.\n\nA Rebalancing strategy will be implemented when the price of assets goes out of the set range as a Stop-loss. Since liquidity is converted to either USDC.e or ETH as a result of price movement, we liquidate the position and swap a half of the liquidity to USDC.e again and re-deposit liquidity with a new range simulated by the statistical approach.\n\nFurthermore, we check all the parameters once a week, even if price still stays within the set range, to update protocol’s rebalancing strategy based on the market situation.\n\nIn the alpha product, only stop loss actions will be executed automatically. After a stop loss is executed, the quant team observes the market situation and rebalances the ranges.\n\nThe strategy includes a comparison of expected returns from fees and potential loss caused by rebalancing.
